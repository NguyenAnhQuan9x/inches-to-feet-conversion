            In the United States, the two length units that are most frequently used are feet (ft) and inches (in).
            Schools, daily life, the arts, and various branches of science and engineering all make use of the units.
            The feet to inches conversion is useful and important, so here's the formula and examples that show how to
            convert <a href="https://www.calculatorful.com/inches-to-feet">inches to feet</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Inches to Feet Formula</h2>
        <p>
            Although it isn't quite as simple as converting between metric units, which are just multiples of 10, it is
            still not a difficult process.<br>
            The conversion factor is:<br>
            <span id="formula">12 inches = foot</span><br>
            <span id="formula"> distance in feet = (distance in inches) / (12 inches/foot)</span><br>
            So, to convert a measurement in feet to inches, all you need to do is multiply the number by 12. This is an
            exact number, so if you're working with significant figures, it won't limit them.
        </p>
        <p>Example: You measure your laptop and find the screen is 15.4 inches across. What is this in feet?
        </p>
        <p>
            distance in feet = (distance in inches) / (12 inches/foot)<br>
            distance = 15.4 in / 12 in/ft<br>
            distance = 1.28 feet<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            In life sometimes we will not have enough time to write the formula then enter the numbers into the calculator 
            and get the result on the screen.
